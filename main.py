# TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries.
#  e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

# TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

# TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#  Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

# TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day
#  before yesterday.

# TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

# STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint:
#  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


# STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""TESLA: ðŸ”º2% Headline: Were Hedge Funds Right About Piling Into Tesla Inc. (TESLA)?. Brief: We at Insider Monkey 
have gone over 821 13F filings that hedge funds and prominent investors are required to file by the SEC The 13F
